# Exercise 001: Regression Trees  

In this exercise you will perform a basic regression tree analysis  

1. Create a `.Rnw` file with the essential elements required to compile a LaTeX document  
2. Add a title and author  
3. Add a bibliography file and insert the following citation:  

```R
@article{breiman2009stone,
  title={Stone, cj (1984) classification and regression trees},
  author={Breiman, L and Friedman, JH and Olshen, RA},
  journal={Wadsworth, Belmont, California},
  year={2009}
}
```
4. Write one or two very breif sentences about regression trees and insert the above reference in the document.  
5. Insert an R Code chunk and run a regression tree on the `Hitters` data from the `ISLR` package. Include the relevant output from your analysis.  
6. Compile the `.Rnw` file into a `pdf`
